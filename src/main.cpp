/**
 * I want to create a way to create strategies based on multiple types of indicators.
 * Integrated into the cpp order-book/engine. Will recieve candles from live trade data via a SPSC (or some other form
 * of IPC). Will send buy and sell notifications to it. Will recieve updates such as amount of money and stocks from
 * each buy/sell. Be able to create a portfolio, show the amount that has been gained/lost, and other metrics. Would be
 * cool to have some form of GUI/TUI rather than a crappy terminal screen.
 *
 * 1. Get candles flowing into the program.
 * 2. Able to manually send buy/sell requests and get anwsers results.
 * 2. Ability to get a simple indicator working (probably SMI)
 * 3. Able to calculate profits/loss
 * */

/**
 * When we get data from the SPSC we put that into a vector/Array (memory pool so we dont keep reallocating mem.)
 * Then we can just use rsi/smi/ema on the past length x - array.length.
 *
 * Then we send a request to the SPSC for order-book to insert a match. The SPSC will open at the start of the program
 * and loop. So idk how we will do this actually.
